# Excel Data Cleaning & Transformation Project

This repository showcases how I used **Microsoft Excel with Power Query** to transform raw, inconsistent sales data into a clean, structured dataset ready for analysis. The project highlights professional data cleaning, transformation, and validation techniques commonly required in real-world business environments.

## Project Overview
The dataset provided was messy and unstructured, containing duplicate records, inconsistent categories, blank values, and combined fields (date and time in a single column). My task was to prepare the data for accurate analysis and reporting by applying systematic cleaning and transformation steps.

## Key Steps Performed

1. **Autofit Columns and Rows**  
   Adjusted the structure for clarity and readability.  

2. **Separate Date and Time**  
   Split combined fields into distinct **Date** and **Time** columns for better trend and time-based analysis.  

3. **Data Cleaning in Power Query**  
   - Removed duplicates (using *Remove Duplicates* and `=UNIQUE()` formula validation).  
   - Trimmed excess spaces and eliminated blank cells.  
   - Standardized categorical data, such as correcting misspellings in the *Rating* column (e.g., fixing “Excellecent” → “Excellent”).  

4. **Data Transformation**  
   - Converted cleaned data into an Excel table for structure.  
   - Cross-checked numerical logic (Quantity × Price per Unit) to validate ratings (*Excellent, Good, Average, Poor*).  

5. **Validation**  
   Verified column data types, formatting, and overall consistency to ensure the dataset was error-free and analysis-ready.

## Outcome
The messy raw file was successfully transformed into a **clean, reliable dataset**. This process ensured:  
- Accurate reporting and analysis.  
- Trustworthy insights for decision-making.  
- A professional, reusable data preparation workflow.
